# Insert a changelog section (read from stdin) into a CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Usage:
#   changelog-for-release.sh 0.28.0 ... | insert-changelog-section.sh CHANGELOG.md
#
# The file keeps one "# Changelog" header with whatever preamble sits under it,
# and its sections stay ordered highest version first. The section goes in by
# version rather than always at the top, so a release cut while an earlier
# release's PR is still open cannot land out of order.
#
# Inserting a version the file already carries is a no-op, so re-running the
# release job cannot stack a duplicate section. Empty or headless stdin is an
# error rather than a silent rewrite, which is what a failed generator upstream
# looks like.
#
# Creates the file if it does not exist yet.
